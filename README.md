Android iBeacon App - FindTheMonkey
===================================
This is a small application that demonstrates how to use the [Xamarin Android iBeacon Service](https://github.com/chrisriesgo/xamarin-android-ibeacon-service) to monitor proximity between an Android 4.3+ BLE device and a hardware Beacon.

This demo should also be capable of ranging an iBeacon created by the [iOS Find The Monkey](https://github.com/mikebluestein/FindTheMonkey) app.
